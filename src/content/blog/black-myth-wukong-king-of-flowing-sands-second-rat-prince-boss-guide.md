## Boss Overview

The King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince are a required Yaoguai Chief miniboss duo encountered in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. They block the path leading out of Sandgate Village.

## Boss Location

Found in Yellow Sand Ridge, Chapter 2:
1. From Sandgate Village Entrance Shrine, head up and right.
2. Pass the sealed town gate to find a valley guarded by enemies.
3. Open the large door on the right to trigger the boss fight.

## Rewards

- Blood of the Iron Bull
- Yaoguai Core x2
- Silk x2
- Stone Spirit x1
- 1102 Experience

## Boss Fight Strategy

### Phase 1: Both Bosses Active

1. The King will avoid direct combat, often burrowing underground or climbing pillars to throw rocks.
2. Focus on the Second Rat Prince, who uses a spiked mace for close-range attacks.
3. Lure the Prince near pillars to make him accidentally knock down the King.
4. The King has low health and can be defeated quickly if exposed.

### Phase 2: Empowered Second Rat Prince

If you defeat the King first:
1. The Prince becomes enraged, gaining massive damage and new attacks.
2. Watch for fissures erupting from his weapon strikes.
3. His attacks become faster and often hit twice in quick succession.
4. New moves include a jumping slam creating a ring of fissures and a weapon toss followed by a leaping dive attack.

## Key Strategies

- You can end the fight by defeating only the Second Rat Prince.
- Defeating the empowered Prince grants his Spirit, which is otherwise unobtainable.
- Consider lowering the Prince's health before killing the King to make the empowered phase shorter.
- Use the Prince as a shield against the King's rock throws.

## Conclusion

This boss fight offers a strategic choice: defeat only the Prince for an easier fight, or risk facing his empowered form for a greater reward. Your decision will impact both the difficulty of the battle and the rewards you receive.
