## Locating Red Loong

Your journey to face Red Loong begins in Chapter 4. Here's how to find this elusive boss:

1. Navigate to the Bitter Lake area
2. Search for a large, ornate door near the lake's shore
3. Use the "Red Loong's Scale" key item to open the door

Note: You must defeat the Cyan Loong boss in Chapter 3 to obtain the "Red Loong's Scale" key item.

## Boss Fight Strategy

Red Loong is a dragon-like creature with mastery over fire and devastating physical attacks. Here are key strategies to emerge victorious:

1. **Dodge the Fire Breath**: Red Loong's signature attack is a wide-ranging fire breath. Dodge sideways or use the Pillar Stance to avoid damage.

2. **Counter Tail Swipes**: Stay alert for sweeping tail attacks. Dodge or use Rock Solid to deflect these strikes.

3. **Avoid Claw Grabs**: Time your dodges carefully when Red Loong attempts to grab you with its claws. Successful evasion opens up counterattack opportunities.

4. **Exploit Elemental Weaknesses**: Red Loong is susceptible to water-based attacks. Utilize water transformation spells or weapons for increased damage.

5. **Beware the Dive Bomb**: In later phases, watch for Red Loong taking flight. Prepare to dodge its devastating dive bomb attack.

## Boss Phases

Understanding Red Loong's battle phases is crucial for victory:

1. **Ground Phase** (100-70% HP): 
   - Primarily uses physical attacks and fire breath
   - Focus on learning attack patterns and finding openings

2. **Flight Phase** (70-30% HP):
   - Red Loong takes to the air
   - Introduces dive bombs and ranged attacks
   - Use ranged abilities or wait for grounded moments to attack

3. **Enraged Phase** (Below 30% HP):
   - Combines ground and air tactics with increased aggression and speed
   - Stay defensive and capitalize on brief openings
