---

The Mother of Stones presents a distinctive challenge as an optional Yaoguai Chief miniboss in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. This guide will help you locate and defeat this unusual foe to gain the powerful ability to transform into a Rock Guai.

## Locating the Mother of Stones

To find this boss:

1. Defeat the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince
2. Head right and cross a rope bridge to enter the Fright Cliff area
3. Pass the Squall Hideout Shrine and keep left
4. Enter a large cave area and take another left turn

## Battle Strategy

This fight is unique as the Mother of Stones herself doesn't move or attack. Instead, you'll face waves of Palestones that emerge to defend her. Here's how to approach the battle:

1. Focus on damaging the Mother of Stones initially
2. Be prepared to quickly shift your attention when she roars, signaling a Palestone's appearance
3. Defeat waves of Palestones while managing your stamina and health:
   - First two waves: Single Palestone each
   - Third and fourth waves: Two Palestones simultaneously

### Tips for Survival

- Use Spirit attacks to focus fire on targets
- Utilize stored Focus Points effectively
- Employ Immobilize and Cloud Step to avoid damage
- Don't hesitate to use your Transformation Spell to quickly neutralize threats
- Create distance to heal when necessary, avoiding projectiles

## Rewards

Defeating the Mother of Stones yields:
- Stone Essence (key item)
- Stone Spirits
- Yaoguai Cores

With this strategy, you'll be well-prepared to overcome this endurance-testing boss fight and claim your prize - the ability to transform into a Rock Guai in Black Myth Wukong.
