## Chapter 3 Boss Overview

Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong features 20 bosses in total, with 5 required bosses and 15 optional ones. This guide will detail the locations and basic strategies for these bosses.

## Required Bosses

There are 5 mandatory bosses in Chapter 3:

1. Captain Wise-Voice - Yaoguai King - Location: Pagoda Realm: Mani Wheel
2. Kang-Jin Loong - Yaoguai King - Location: Snowhill Path: Mirrormere
3. Kang-Jin-Star - Yaoguai King - Location: Bitter Lake: Turtle Island
4. Captain Kalpa-Wave - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Valley of Ecstasy: Longevity Road
5. Yellowbrow - Yaoguai King - Location: New Thunderclap Temple: Temple Entrance

Note: Yellowbrow is the only boss that must be fought twice in this chapter.

### Kang-Jin Loong Strategy

- Kang-Jin Loong's aerial attacks are her most dangerous moves
- Once you deal enough damage, she gets knocked down, providing an opportunity for powerful spell attacks

### Captain Wise-Voice Strategy

- Focus on attacking the boss's legs until it collapses
- When down, its golden core is exposed, allowing for significant damage
- Be cautious of its ultimate attack when its health drops below 50%

## Optional Bosses

Chapter 3 includes 15 optional bosses with 18 possible encounters:

1. Cyan Loong - Yaoguai King - Location: Bitter Lake: Turtle Island
2. Captain Lotus-Vision - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Pagoda Realm: Mani Wheel
3. Macaque Chief - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Snowhill Path: Frost-Clad Path (3 possible encounters)
4. Non-White - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Valley of Ecstasy: Mindfulness Cliff
5. Non-Able - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Valley of Ecstasy: Brook of Bliss
6. Non-Pure - Yaoguai Chief - Location: New Thunderclap Temple: Temple Entrance
7. Chen Loong - Character - Location: Bitter Lake: North Shore of the Bitter Lake
8. Yin Tiger - Character - Location: Zodiac Village: Village Entrance
9. Old Ginseng Guai - Yaoguai Chief - Location: Valley of Ecstasy: Forest of Felicity
10. Green-Capped Martialist - Character - Location: Valley of Ecstasy: Melon Field

14. Non-Void - Yaoguai Chief - Location: New Thunderclap Temple: Temple Entrance
15. Monk From The Sea - Yaoguai Chief - Location: New Thunderclap Temple: Temple Entrance

### Chen Loong Strategy

- Chen Loong has a complex moveset that can be challenging
- However, he's relatively fragile, so frequent use of spells can quickly overpower him

### Yin Tiger Strategy

- Start the battle by using the Spellseal spell
- Spellseal increases attack power based on your current mana
- While it prevents the use of other spells, the damage boost significantly helps in depleting Yin Tiger's HP

## Secret Bosses

Chapter 3 also features two secret bosses:

1. Erlang, The Sacred Divinity
2. The Four Heavenly Kings

### Erlang Strategy

- Focus on depleting the boss's posture bar, located above the HP bar
- Continuous attacks will drain the bar, causing the boss to stagger
- Use the "A Pluck of Many" spell to create clones for additional hits

### Four Heavenly Kings Strategy

- Located in the Secret: Mount Mei area, accessible after defeating the final boss
- A straightforward, cinematic boss fight with simplified versions of familiar movesets

This guide should help players navigate through all the boss encounters in Chapter 3 of Black Myth: Wukong. Good luck and enjoy the game!
