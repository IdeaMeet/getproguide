As Assetto Corsa enthusiasts, we often find ourselves needing to manage our mods and content efficiently. AC Content Manager has been a popular tool for this purpose, but what if you need to remove it completely? Whether you're troubleshooting issues, switching to alternatives, or just starting fresh, this guide will walk you through the process of uninstalling AC Content Manager thoroughly.

## Table of contents

## Step 1: Locate Your Content Manager Files

Before we begin the uninstallation process, it's crucial to know where Content Manager files are stored on your PC:

- Content Manager Executable: 
  `C:\Program Files\Content Manager\ContentManager.exe`
- Data and Settings Folder:
  `%appdata%\Local\AcTools Content Manager`

Note: The `%appdata%` folder is hidden by default. To access it, open File Explorer and paste `%appdata%` in the navigation bar.

## Step 2: Delete the Content Manager Executable

1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\Content Manager`
2. Right-click on the `ContentManager.exe` file
3. Select "Delete"
4. Confirm the file deletion in the prompt

## Step 3: Wipe All Content Manager Data and Settings

1. Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog
2. Type `%appdata%` and press Enter
3. Open the "Local" folder
4. Open the "AcTools Content Manager" folder
5. Select and delete this entire folder

This step will remove all Content Manager settings, preferences, caches, custom shaders, and installed content/mods.

## Step 4: Delete AssettoCorsa.exe (Optional)

For a more thorough cleanup, you can also delete the main AssettoCorsa.exe file located at:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Assetto Corsa`

Note that you'll need to reinstall Assetto Corsa through Steam afterwards if you choose this option.

## Step 5: Verify Uninstall and Reinstall Assetto Corsa

To ensure Content Manager is fully removed:

1. Launch Assetto Corsa from Steam
2. Check if any errors occur without Content Manager
3. Optionally reinstall Assetto Corsa again

If issues persist, you may need to manually delete the Assetto Corsa `graphics` and `setup` folders at:

`C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\Assetto Corsa`

## Content Manager Alternatives

If you're looking for alternatives to Content Manager, consider these options:

1. RaceDepartment (Free) - Great for mod downloads and community interaction
2. Vortex (Free) - Lightweight and easy to use
3. OpenVR (Free/$4) - Advanced VR & input tuning capabilities

Each manager has its strengths, so choose based on your specific needs and preferences.

## Conclusion

Uninstalling AC Content Manager doesn't have to be a daunting task. By following these steps, you can ensure a clean removal and start fresh with your Assetto Corsa setup. Whether you're troubleshooting issues or exploring new content management options, this guide should help you navigate the process smoothly.

Remember, the sim racing community is vast and supportive. Don't hesitate to reach out to fellow enthusiasts or consult forums if you encounter any unique issues during the uninstallation process.
