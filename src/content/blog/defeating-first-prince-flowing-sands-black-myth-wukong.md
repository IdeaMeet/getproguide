The First Prince of Flowing Sands presents a formidable challenge in Chapter 2 of Black Myth Wukong. This optional Yaoguai Chief miniboss lurks in a large valley cave beyond Sandgate Village, guarding valuable rewards and secrets. Here's how to locate and defeat this powerful foe.

## Locating the First Prince

You can find the First Prince in the Valley of Despair, past Sandgate Village in Chapter 2's Yellow Wind Ridge. Your approach depends on your previous encounter with the King of Flowing Sands and Second Rat Prince:

1. If you spared the King, he'll flee to this area and summon the First Prince before meeting his demise.
2. If you defeated both the King and Second Prince, use the Pungent Flesh Chunk key item at the valley's cliff edge to summon the First Prince.

## Battle Strategy

The First Prince is a massive, unpredictable opponent with devastating attacks. Here are key tactics to overcome this challenge:

1. Utilize Cloud Step to evade attacks and quickly counterattack from the sides.
2. Watch for his opening lunging slam attack and dodge sideways to punish.
3. Be prepared for alternating hand slams and sweeping attacks that require different evasion timing.
4. When he stands with arms outstretched, prepare to dodge his toppling body slam.
5. Beware of his quick lunge attack, signaled by a subtle arm extension.
6. Don't get too comfortable on his flanks, as he can counter with tail swipes and backhand strikes.

## Secret Discovery

During the fight, try to lure the First Prince into attacking the curved wall adorned with small statues. His powerful strikes may crack the wall, revealing a hidden passage to a secret area containing valuable loot.

## Rewards

Defeating the First Prince of Flowing Sands yields:
- Arhat Hold Piece (key item)
- 2 Silk
- 2 Yarn
- 1102 Experience
- 1020 Will

With these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to face this challenging boss and uncover the secrets he guards in Black Myth Wukong.
